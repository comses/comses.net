        Our mission is to help computational modelers at all levels engage in the <a href='https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org'>establishment and adoption of community standards</a> and <a href='{{ slugurl("guides-to-good-practice") }}'>good practices</a> for developing and sharing computational models. Model authors can freely publish their model source code in the Computational Model Library alongside narrative documentation, open science metadata, and other emerging open science norms that facilitate software citation, reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. Model authors can also request <a href='/reviews/'>peer review</a> of their computational models to receive a DOI.
        </p>
        <p>
        All users of models published in the library <b>must cite model authors</b> when they use and benefit
        from their code.

    We also maintain a <a href='https://catalog.comses.net'>curated database of over 7500 publications of
    agent-based and individual based models</a> with additional detailed metadata on availability of code and
    bibliometric information on the landscape of ABM/IBM publications that we welcome you to explore.
