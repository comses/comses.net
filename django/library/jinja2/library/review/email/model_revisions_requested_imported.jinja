Dear {{ review.contact_author_name }},

The reviewer for your computational model [{{ release.title }}]({{ build_absolute_uri(release.share_url) }}) has recommended that changes be made to your model. These are summarized below:

Since this release is imported from GitHub, you will need to update it there and then re-import it into CoMSES Net. Here is the process:

1. **Commit and push your changes:** Make the necessary changes to your code and push them to your GitHub repository.
2. **Edit the release on GitHub:** Go to the [release page on GitHub]({{ imported_release_package.html_url }}) to edit the release.
3. **Update the release tag:**
  - In the release edit form, you can choose which tag or branch the release should be associated with.
  - To include your latest changes, you should create a new tag. You can do this by typing a new version number in the "Tag version" box and selecting "Create new tag: [new_version] on publish". Make sure this new tag points to the branch with your recent commits.
  - Keep in mind that the original version number will be kept, so its recommended to append a suffix to the tag instead of incrementing, e.g. "v1.0.0-rev1"
4. **Confirm the release has been updated:** Follow [this link]({{ build_absolute_uri(release.get_edit_url()) }}) to confirm that the release has been updated, making sure files are categorized and metadata is complete.
5. **Notify reviewer:** Once changes have been made, use the "Notify Reviewer of Changes" button to send an alert to the reviewer.
