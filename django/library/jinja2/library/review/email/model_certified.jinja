Dear {{ review.submitter.name }},

Congratulations! The peer review of your model [{{ release.title }}]({{ release_url }}) is now complete and your release has been marked as peer reviewed. Your release will remain private until you [publish it yourself]({{release_publish_url}}). An automatic DOI registration workflow that automatically assigns a DOI to all peer reviewed models is slated for development by Q2 2024. If you need a DOI immediately please feel free to [contact us]({{ build_absolute_uri(slugurl('contact')) }}).

Thank you for submitting your computational model for review to CoMSES Net! We hope you will be willing to serve as a reviewer of model code as well in future model peer reviews.

Best regards,
The CoMSES Net Editors
