# FIXME: should we synchronize DOI metadata after backups or before backups?
# Pros of after backups: DOI metadata syncing alters the DB and taking a snapshot backup before running this may protect against
# errors or bugs that happened as a result of the sync
#
# Pros of before backups: backups will be more up-to-date
#
# currently syncing after backups
