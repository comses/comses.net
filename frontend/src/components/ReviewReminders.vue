      <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Peer reviews must be requested on
      <strong>unpublished model releases</strong> so that you can continue to revise your submission
      based on reviewer guidance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you have already published this release,
        <strong>a new draft will be created</strong> as an exact copy in order to allow for changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If this release was imported from GitHub and published, you will not be able to request a
        review, and will need to create a new release on GitHub for peer review to take place on.

    <p class="mb-0">
      Once a model release passes peer review it will remain private until you choose to publish it,
      at which point you may set a version number. Please note that
      <strong>uploaded files cannot be modified after review</strong>
      regardless of published status, though metadata will remain editable.

    <p><strong>Note on Uploaded Data</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-0">
      <small>
        The CoMSES Computational Model Library stores uploaded data files in
        <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/data/</code> and code in <code>&lt;project-root&gt;/code/</code>.
        Uploaded data files can be referenced by your model with a relative path like
        <code>"../data/my-input-data.csv"</code>. If you uploaded a zipfile with a nested directory
        structure you may need to go up several directories to get to the project root before
        descending back down into the data directory, depending on where your source code files
        exist within that nested directory structure. For example, a Python script in a
        <code>src/python/</code> directory would have to reference uploaded data files in
        <code>"../../../data/"</code>). This limitation can be circumvented by including your data
        in your source code zipfile, referencing relative paths to your input data directly in your
        code, and ignoring the CoMSES data upload slot.
