      A codebase release should ideally include the source code, documentation, input data and
      dependencies necessary for someone else (including your future self) to understand, replicate,
      or reuse the model. Please note that we impose a specific directory structure to organize your
      uploaded files - you can view the active filesystem layout below. Source code is placed in
      <code>project-root/code/</code>, data files are placed in <code>project-root/data/</code>, and
      documentation files are placed in <code>project-root/docs/</code>, and simulation outputs are
      placed in <code>project-root/results/</code>. This means that if your source code has
      references to your uploaded data files you should consider using the relative path
      <code>../data/&lt;datafile&gt;</code> to access those data files. This will make the lives of
      others wishing to review, download and run your model easier.
    </p>
    <p v-else>
      Below is the current filesystem layout of the archival package. Since this release has already
      been published, the files can no longer be edited.
